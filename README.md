This repository contains all the code I've been using to build my data analysis and calibration pipelines for the NASA OSIRIS-REx mission. Specifically, I am interested in the OSIRIS-REx Thermal Emission Spectrometer (OTES) and its data. The interferometer data from OTES comes in .dat files with corresponding .xml files to decrypt. The code for that can be found in dat_processing.py. The emissivity data from OTES comes in .HDF5 files and the code for that can be found in replicatinghamiltondata.py.
